# Weather-Planner
A weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

##
When the user types in a city name, the app will pull weather data from the Open Weather Map: https://openweathermap.org/api.

The app will also create buttons for the user's search history so that they can return to the weather data from previous cities that they have searched.
